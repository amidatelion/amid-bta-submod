# amid-bta-submod
Submod with BTA3062 tweaks. Provided without support. Versions are pinned to BTA versions. 

## CustomSalvage

Changes salvage parameters so that when mechs are salvaged, their components have high chances to come broken or destroyed. The chance is lowered with higher tech points (TP).

All credit to Kiren for the mod.json.

## BT Advanced Starters

Adds a Nova Cat start. Mostly Omnimechs, Early Clan (EC) with a chance to get Heavies and low chance to get Assaults.
